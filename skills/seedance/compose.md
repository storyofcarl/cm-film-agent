name: seedance-compose
description: Compose a Seedance 2.0/2.5 shot ACTION prompt from ordered keyframe images + reference images + optional draft text. Keyframes are the approved design and override the text; dialogue and names ride verbatim. Two-step pipeline — derive events from the keyframes alone, then enrich with references.

# Seedance Compose — keyframes → shot action prompt

Use this skill when the user has a set of reference images for one video shot — some of
them marked as ORDERED KEYFRAMES (the compositions the shot opens on, passes through,
and lands on) — and wants the shot's action prompt written for Seedance 2.0 or 2.5.

## Inputs

- **Images, in send order** — the exact images the video model will receive, numbered
  `[Image 1] … [Image N]`. The user tells you which are keyframes and their order
  (e.g. "keyframes: Image 2 → Image 5 → Image 6"). The rest are identity references
  (characters, places, props).
- **Draft text** (optional) — the user's existing prompt or script fragment.
- **Target model** — `seedance-2.0` (≤15 s take) or `seedance-2.5` (≤30 s take).
- **Duration** — the shot's length in seconds.

## Authority contract

- **Keyframes given → the pictures rule.** Derive the shot's events FROM the keyframe
  path; what changes between the keyframes IS the performance. From the draft text
  carry ONLY what pictures cannot show: every dialogue line word-for-word in curly
  braces with its speaker named, proper names, and intent that does not contradict
  the images. List every draft event you overrode — never drop content silently.
- **No keyframes → the text rules.** The draft is the material and the authority on
  what happens: carry its wording, events and dialogue verbatim; re-structure and
  ground it against the reference images, never re-invent it.

## Procedure

**Step 1 — DERIVE (keyframes only).** Look ONLY at the keyframe images, in order.
Ignore the draft text entirely in this step (so it cannot anchor you). Narrate the
shot's events chronologically, keyframe to keyframe: name each figure by a short
consistent visual handle, prefer slow continuous movement with natural inertia,
externalize emotion as visible physical detail. No dialogue, no camera directions,
no binding lines — events only. Pace the events to the duration, no more.

**Step 2 — ENRICH (everything).** Rewrite the derived events into the final action:
replace each visual handle with its subject's real `[Image N]` number; keep the event
order and pacing; weave the draft's dialogue verbatim at the right moments; open with
a ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY (subject + location + event + style + camera). Sound effects
in angle brackets `<…>`, music in full-width parens `（…）`.

## Craft rules (always)

- Camera is NAMED grammar — professional terms used raw (shot size, angle, movement,
  techniques like long take / dolly zoom / speed ramp), ONE camera treatment per
  segment; niche terms as `[term + plain description]`.
- Motion lives at TWO altitudes — general verbs carry the flow ("the two engage in
  close combat"); degree-and-speed micro-detail is spent on only one or two
  story-bearing beats per shot; NEVER repeat an action phrase (repetition loops the
  motion); adverbs set speed.
- Expressions are descriptive sentences, never idioms. Phrase everything positively —
  say what happens, not what doesn't.
- A transition names its trigger AND method ("at 5s, a quick left wipe with a natural
  dissolve") and never dangles at the end of the text.

## Model targets

- **seedance-2.5** — one continuous take up to 30 s. For a shot longer than ~12 s,
  structure the action as CONTINUOUS integer-second intervals (`0-3s: … 3-8s: …`, no
  gaps), roughly ONE event cluster per 2–4 seconds; each interval carries its OWN
  camera, action, dialogue and sound; time-POINTS for accents ("at the 5-second
  mark, …"). Never overpack an interval (phantom cuts) or leave one thin (invites
  improvisation).
- **seedance-2.0** — one continuous take at most 15 s; a tight, unbroken event chain
  in plain event order. NO timestamps (2.0 ignores them).

## Never write

Composition-binding lines ("opens exactly on…", "Use Image k as a keyframe"), subject
definitions ("Define the person in…"), quality/ratio/duration lines, or transition
markers dangling at the end — the caller's compiler adds structure around your text.

## Output

Return ONLY JSON, no prose, no code fences:

```json
{"action": "<the shot's action text>",
 "audio": "<one sound line in the symbol grammar, or empty>",
 "dropped": ["<a draft event the keyframes overrode, or omit>"]}
```
