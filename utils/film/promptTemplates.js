Exclude anything seen only once in passing or pure background. Decide the film's ONE visual style FIRST (medium, palette, light, grade, era); every asset shares it.

Pick the RIGHT type for each — do NOT force everything into a frontal portrait:
• "character" — a PERSON or animal that recurs and gets CLOSE-UPS; its face is locked identity. Distinct characters must be visibly DIFFERENT individuals (never reuse one face for two roles). Needs a frontal FACE portrait + a full-body turnaround sheet.
• "creature" — a supernatural, monstrous or ANTAGONIST presence that is NOT meant to be seen as a clean ID photo (obscured, atmospheric, barely glimpsed). Needs ONE "presence" plate: shown IN ITS OWN LIGHT and only PARTIALLY revealed — silhouette / half-lit / wreathed in its element — NEVER a neutral frontal mugshot.
• "location" — an environment / set a scene lives in. ONE establishing plate, no people.
• "prop" — a recurring OBJECT or VEHICLE that must look identical every time it appears (a car / convoy, a weapon, a signature object). ONE clean reference plate, neutral or minimal in-world context, no people.

• background and atmosphere — secondary life, weather, haze, dust, light behavior
• VFX where the events imply them, described physically
• sound — weave <sfx> and (music) moments at the right beats; dialogue stays untouched

The FIRST sentence of "action" is a ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY — subject + location + event + style + camera — then the detail. Write the performance in event order, walking the shot along the keyframe path: address every subject by its [Image N] number; movement speed FOLLOWS the action's nature — a strike or impact is fast and crisp, a hesitation or realization is slow — but ALL motion is CONTINUOUS with natural inertia and follow-through (nothing teleports, nothing loops); characters never look at the camera. Sound effects in angle brackets <…>, music in parentheses (…).

STATE THE SITUATION, DO NOT CHOREOGRAPH THE OUTCOME. The video model SIMULATES a world: give it who is there, where, in what condition, and what they are trying to do — it derives the physical consequences itself, and derives them better than a written body-part script. Name a state of the subject ("the wolf is cornered and means it") rather than instructing a feature ("guard hairs lift") — a feature instruction gets rendered literally, and literally is wrong.

(b) attention rhythm (poses a new question / raises stakes / withholds / reverses / releases) — never the same operation three times running; place a breath after a reversal. (c) geography — hold one axis, sizes progress with intensity, re-establish wide after an axis or location change. (d) at most 4 named subjects per shot.

The script's SCENE HEADINGS (numbered INT./EXT. sluglines) are HARD boundaries: a shot NEVER spans two scenes; the geography rules apply WITHIN a scene and every new scene re-establishes; each slug's location and time ground the shot, and an UNSTATED slug field stays undecided — never invent it.

{countGoal}

{refCount} REFERENCE IMAGES are attached as [Image 1] … [Image {refCount}] ({refCount} may be 0).

For EACH shot return:
• beat — a 2–4 word name.
• job — ONE short line: what this shot's actor is up against and what they are trying to do. A shot whose job you cannot state does not belong in the list.
• shotTemplate — the EXACT id of the best-fit camera setup from the LIBRARY:
{templates}
• figures — the reference numbers that APPEAR in this shot (≥1 when references exist; [] when none attached).
• intExt — "INT" or "EXT".
• scene — the 1-based number of the SCENE HEADING this shot falls under (1 when the script has no headings).
• span — THIS SHOT'S PORTION OF THE SCRIPT, COPIED VERBATIM: the exact characters, dialogue word-for-word, nothing paraphrased, nothing summarized. The spans PARTITION the script IN ORDER — every story-relevant line lands in exactly ONE shot's span, no gaps, no overlaps. Scene headings and trailing global sections (style / audio notes that apply to the whole film) belong to NO span.

Return ONLY a JSON object — no prose, no code fences:
{"shots":[{"beat":"…","job":"…","shotTemplate":"…","figures":[…],"intExt":"EXT","scene":1,"span":"…"}],"reply":"<ONE short line to the director>"}`,

THE SHOT HAS ONE JOB (stated in the instruction). Every sentence you write either advances that job or earns its place some other way — cut anything that serves neither. The job decides what the camera favors, what the performance emphasizes, and what the frame withholds.

Write "motion" as plain event-order prose — NEVER numeric time markers; the sequence of events carries time, and each event's observable outcome makes the order unambiguous.

{refCount} REFERENCE IMAGES are attached as [Image 1] … [Image {refCount}] — address each subject you use explicitly as [Image N].

Never a lineup, never a neutral standing pose. In this order: (1) SUBJECT — 'The <subject> in [Image N] is the main subject — keep their exact identity, facial features, body proportions and temperament unchanged' (place/object: 'the exact <place/object> in [Image N]'); the reference gives IDENTITY ONLY — the POSE comes from this shot's situation and never from the reference's own pose.

 "motion": "<the shot's SITUATION for the video model, in event order — who is there, in what condition, what each is trying to do, and what happens as a result. The model simulates the world and derives the physical detail, so state the situation and the observable outcome; do NOT write a body-part script and do NOT instruct individual features (say a subject is cornered and means it, never that its hackles lift — a feature instruction renders literally). Every action at real-world speed; as many sentences as the span needs and NO more. Address subjects by the same [Image N] numbers.
